## My Emacs configuration

This is my minimal Emacs configuration, just basic and python stuff. `use-package` is used
heavily, it should install all 3rd party stuff on first start, so you might get yourself a
cup of tea. You will need some system packages to support 3rd party stuff. Just grep the
source for `apt install` to see those. Tested with Emacs 29.
